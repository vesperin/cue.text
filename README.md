## Vesperin's Introspector

Text mining and concept analysis

### Steps for running the Introspector's CLI

- Unzip the file bin.zip
- cd bin

From your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
$ ./intros -f path/to/source-files/ -t path/to/file.json
```

or the following command if you want your results to be printed on your terminal:


```bash
$ ./intros -f path/to/source-files/
```


The above commands will produce some JSON content (either stored in a file or printed on 
the screen). This JSON content consists of a list of word packages (or word packs). Each 
entry in the pack represents a class and its methods. A class is represented as 
`{name: <classname>, words: [], children: []}`, where `words` is a list of words extracted 
from the class name (non english words are skipped; e.g., itrs), and `children` is a list of 
methods belonging to the class in question. Each method is represented in a similar 
way as classes. The only difference is that they `children` list is empty.  Here is an example
of the JSON content generated by the Introspector's CLI:  


```json
{
  "wordPacks": [
    {
      "name": "WordsInStringTokenizer",
      "words": [
        { "word": "string", "count": 1 },
        { "word": "word", "count": 1 },
        { "word": "token", "count": 1 }
      ],
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "WordsInStringTokenizer", <<<< constructor
          "words": [
            { "word": "string", "count": 1 },
            { "word": "word", "count": 1 },
            { "word": "token", "count": 1 }
          ],
          "children": []
        },
        {
          "name": "clear",
          "words": [{ "word": "clear", "count": 1 }],
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
