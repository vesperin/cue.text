Hadoop
makes
it
possible
to
run
applications
on
systems
with
thousands
of
nodes
involving
thousands
of
terabytes
Its
distributed
file system
facilitates
rapid
data transfer
rates
among
nodes
and
allows
the
system
to
continue
operating
uninterrupted
in
case
of
a
node
failure
This
approach
lowers
the
risk
of
catastrophic
system
failure
even
if
a
significant
number
of
nodes
become
inoperative
Google
a
software
framework
in
which
an
application
is
broken
down
into
numerous
small
parts
Any
of
these
parts
also
called
fragments
or
blocks
can
be
run
on
any
node
in
the
cluster
Doug
Cutting
Hadoop
creator
named
the
framework
after
his
stuffed
toy
elephant
The
current
Apache
Hadoop
ecosystem
consists
of
the
Hadoop
kernel
the
Hadoop
distributed
file
system
and
a
number
of
related
projects
such
as
Apache
Hive
HBase
and
Zookeeper
The
Hadoop
framework
is
used
by
major
players
including
Google
Yahoo
and
IBM
largely
for
applications
involving
search
engines
and
advertising.
The preferred
operating
systems
are
Windows
and
Linux
but
Hadoop
can
also
work
with
BSD
and
OSX
